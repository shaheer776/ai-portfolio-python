    "### 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. These objects can contain data, in the form of fields (attributes), and code, in the form of procedures (methods). OOP helps in building programs that are more modular, reusable, and easier to understand.\n",
    "Python supports OOP and allows you to create and work with objects using classes. It helps in modeling real-world entities, making your code more organized and maintainable. Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into **objects**, which are instances of **classes**. It provides a clear structure for the code and promotes **reusability**, **modularity**, and **abstraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four key principles of OOP:\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an objectâ€™s methods.\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: The ability to use a shared interface for multiple forms (methods with the same name behaving differently based on the object).\n"
